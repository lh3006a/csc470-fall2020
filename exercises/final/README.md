# Save The Holidays From The Evil Snowmen
Take the holidays back from evil snowmen after they try to steal the holiday cheer.  

## Plan
Evil snowmen have stolen the holidays and it is up to you to save the town's cheer. The goal of this game is to find all of the things that were stolen and bring them back to the center of the town without losing your holiday cheer. The player will have to run around town and find all of the things that the snowmen stole from the houses. These objects are: 
* Presents
* Gingerbread Cookies
* Mittens
* Hot Chocolate
* Sled
* Ice Skates

 The player has a cheer meter that is shown at the top of the screen and everytime they get caught moving in the snowmen's shadows the cheer meter will go down. The evil snowmen are close to each of the objects and rotate with a shadow that the user has to avoid moving in. There is a fade in fade out so that the user gets more feedback that they were caught, besides just the meter. If the meter reaches zero, the game is over. There is a textbox that shows the player how many items they have collected and how many more they need to collect.  


The player is able to pick the color of their sled at the beginning of the game. The player uses the arrow keys to move around town and collect the different items that were stolen. The objects have blue particles coming off of them so that they are easier to see. The camera will be slightly behind the player and move with them. The game takes place during the night so it will be a little dark, with snow coming down. There are different houses and trees spread out throughout the town. There are roads that the player can move on while searching for the objects. The roads are set up so that they intersect with one another, but it will not be too complicated. The objects will be scattered around the roads and houses, but have a blue particle effect on them so that the user can see them from far away. The user goes down the streets to try to find the objects. The entire games has an instrumental version of "Walking in a Winter Wonderland." The user has to make it back to the town hall, that is lit up in blue lightening. 


If the user's cheer meter reaches zero, the game over screen will play, and then the user is taken back to the title page. There is also a bonus round for users that win the game. The bonus round is a matching game where the users have to match the objects that they found during the first round. Animation is used with the cards to flip them when they are clicked. The color of the card also changes so that the user knows if it is selected or not. There is also a button that users can press that will bring them back to the title screen if they do not want to play the matching game.

* This screenshot is what is seen by the user during the game. The snowman has a shadow and rotates with the shadow. The snow can be seen falling. 
**Bonus Round:** ![alt text](https://github.com/lh3006a/csc470-fall2020/blob/master/exercises/final/match.png)
* This screenshot shows the matching game. The squares change to a darker blue if they are selected and will turn around to show the object. If the two cards match, they will remain turned around and dark blue, but if they do not match, the cards will turn back to light blue and turn back around. 

### Set Targets
1. The user does not have to worry about hiding from the grinch. There will be no shadow that moves as the player gets closer to an object. There are only a couple of houses in the town, so it is easy to navigate around and find the objects. The character sprite will run, but it will not be animated. There will be audio for the title and instruction scenes but not during game play. 
2. The player will have to stop moving when they get near one of the objects and the grinch. Once the player gets close to the object that they are trying to pick up, there will be a shadow that shows the grinch's gaze. If the player is in the shadow, they cannot move or they will be caught by the grinch. If they are caught the holiday meter will go down. The shadow will be moving from side to side so when the shadow is not on the player they can move. There will be lots of houses around the town that will make navigation slightly more difficult. 
3. The character sprite will be animated to look like it is running when moving and standing still when not moving. There will be a map in the corner of the screen that shows the user where the character sprite is in the town and where the objects are hidden around town. I would like to try and add movement to the camera. If the user presses a button then they are able to move the camera instead of the player to look around and try to find the objects. 

## Timeline
The design document is due on Monday, November 23rd. I would like to have designed the game space, characters, and finished the bulk of the character script, including movement, and triggers by Thursday, November 26th. By Monday November 30th, I want to have the meter working and to have at least started trying to figure out how to cast a shadow that the player cannot move in. I also want to have the title screen, instructions, and end of the game scene that links back to the main page done by Thursday. By Thursday, December 3rd, I want to have the audio mostly figured out. If I am feeling good about where the project is, I want to try to add animation to the character and try to create the navigation map that would go in the corner of the play screen. I want to have the game working and finished by December 7th so that I can start going over it and fixing little things to make it easier to play and nicer to look at.

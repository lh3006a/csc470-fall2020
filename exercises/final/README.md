# Save The Holidays From The Grinch
Take the holidays back from the Grinch after he tries to steal the holiday cheer.  

## Plan
The Grinch has stolen the holidays and it is up to you to save the town's cheer. The goal of this game is to find all of the things that the Grinch has stolen and bring them back to the center of the town before time runs out and without being losing your holiday cheer. The player will have to run around town and find all of the things that the Grinch stole from the houses. Such as:
* Lights
* Presents
* Cookies
* Holiday music
* Snowmen
* Mittens
* Hot Chocolate
* Sled

When an object is found, the players holiday meter raises slightly if it has gone down. The player will have a holiday meter and everytime they get caught by the Grinch the holiday meter will go down. If the meter reaches zero, the game is over. If the player is not able to get back to the center of the town when time runs out, the game is also over. 


The player will be able to pick their sprite at the beginning of the game. The user will use the arrow keys to run around town and collect the different items that were stolen. The game takes place during the night so it will be a little dark, with houses that are covered in snow. I am hoping that the town will look realistic, but also very cute and maybe a little cartoony. There will be roads that the player will run down while searching for the objects. The roads will be set up so that they intersect with one another and it will not be too complicated. The objects will be scattered around the roads and houses, but will have a particle effect so that the user can see them from far away. The user will walk down the streets to try to find the objects. The title screen and instructions for the game will have some kind of holiday music. During the gameplay, I am going to try to have snow crunching sounds when the user is running, and mute the sounds when they are stopped.

### Set Targets
1. The user does not have to worry about hiding from the Grinch. There will be no shadow that moves as the player gets closer to an object. There are only a couple of houses in the town, so it is easy to navigate around and find the objects. The character sprite will run, but it will not be animated. There will be audio for the title and instruction scenes but not during game play. 
2. The player will have to stop moving when they get near one of the objects and the Grinch. Once the player gets close to the object that they are trying to pick up, there will be a shadow that shows the Grinch's gaze. If the player is in the shadow, they cannot move or they will be caught by the Grinch. If they are caught the holiday meter will go down. The shadow will be moving from side to side so when the shadow is not on the player they can move. There will lots of houses around the town that will make navigation slightly more difficult. 
3. The character sprite will be animated to look like it is running when moving and standing still when not moving. There will be a map in the corner of the screen that shows the user where the character sprite is in the town and where the objects are hidden around town. 

## Timeline
The design document is due on Monday, November 23rd. I would like to have designed the game space, characters, and finished the bulk of the character script, including movement, and triggers by Thursday, November 26th. I also want to have the title screen, instructions, and end of the game scene that links back to the main page done by Thursday. By Monday November 30th, I want to have the meter working and to have at least started trying to figure out how to cast a shadow that the player cannot move in. By Thursday, December 3rd, I want to have the audio mostly figured out. If I am feeling good about where the project is, I want to try to add animation to the character and try to create the navigation map that would go in the corner of the play screen. I want to have the game working and finished by December 7th so that I can start going over it and fixing little things to make it easier to play and nicer to look at.
